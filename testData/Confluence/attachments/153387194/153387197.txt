-To get the .c2v file from the test cell PC to your laptop to send to Craig, place the
.c2v file in Z:\A_N_D_Folder, and you should be able to access it from there. To map the
Z: drive on your laptop and/or the test cell PC, in Windows File Explorer, go to This PC, and
using the topbar options, select "Computer" > "Map Network Drive", set 'Drive' to Z: and
'Folder' to \\ice-batna-win.gm.com\Config and you should be all set.

-If you can't find the Digi serial hub:
1. Make sure the correct ethernet cables are plugged into the correct NIC ports on the PC
2. Use DigiDeviceDiscovery.exe in the Digibox install folder to check the status of the switch

-Check that the IPs for the "IO Rack" and "Serial" Ethernet ports are set accordingly:
IO Rack: 192.168.128.254, 255.255.255.0
Serial: 20.0.0.1, 255.255.255.0

-I would set the "StartDriver" procedures to not have the ";SILENT" handle at the end to be
able to see what the drivers are actually doing to help troubleshoot problems. If you have
issues with the chambers not responding but the driver is started, make sure to check the Digi
devices either next to or behind the chambers. Double check the COM Port assignments in Test
Manager match where each of the chamber ethernet cables go.
>Digi Port 1 - COM Port 2
>Digi Port 2 - COM Port 6
>Digi Port 3 - COM Port 7
>Digi Port 4 - COM Port 8 (CALIBRATION ONLY)

-If you start iTest and the thermocouples like tBattNegative are not reading correctly, check
CirAssignChans.dat for whether or not the respective channels are assigned to anything, check
the assigned channels for the circuits by going to the "Circuit Editor" window under "Battery 
Setup" in the Test Manager solution tree, and check the Bitrode driver "Assignable database" 
at the bottom of the driver configuration window in Test Manager and make sure any of the 
tCyclerX_1X Channels are on "Slot" 3.

-If there are issues with getting iTest to connect with LabCentral, even if you use "Test
Connection" from the iView setup from the bottom right of the taskbar tray, it may be an issue
with LabCentral "handshaking back", in which case you just need to make an edit to the
description of the "BcTS" Test System Group in LabCentral, under Test Systems. When you make
an edit and select "save", it will force a communication push TO the iTest machine and you
should be able to make a connection.
