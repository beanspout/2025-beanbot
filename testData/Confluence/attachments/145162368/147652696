-DO THIS AS SOON AS DANA GIVES YOU THE GO AHEAD ON THE NEXT PC TO UPGRADE, IT WILL SAVE TIME
If there's a PC that needs to be upgraded, there's a ticket here to do so, 
IT Store - Shop for Services (gm.com), selecting Technician assistance and 
telling Andy which TCWS (test cell work station) it is should be enough.
To get the TCWS info, simply go to Windows Settings > System > About, and
it will simply be the device name. If you can't find it in the dropdown on the 
IT site, select "Searched and asset not found" from the dropdown and enter the 
necessary info from there. The PC will be down for around a day or two between 
the upgrade and installs.

-To get the .c2v file from the test cell PC to your laptop to send to Craig, place the
.c2v file in Z:\A_N_D_Folder, and you should be able to access it from there. To map the
Z: drive on your laptop and/or the test cell PC, in Windows File Explorer, go to This PC, and
using the topbar options, select "Computer" > "Map Network Drive", set 'Drive' to Z: and
'Folder' to \\ice-batna-win.gm.com\Config and you should be all set.

-If you can't find the Digi serial hub:
1. Make sure the correct ethernet cables are plugged into the correct NIC ports on the PC
2. Use DigiDeviceDiscovery.exe in the Digibox install folder to check the status of the switch

-Check that the IPs for the "IO Rack" and "Serial" Ethernet ports are set accordingly:
IO Rack: 192.168.128.254, 255.255.255.0
Serial: 20.0.0.1, 255.255.255.0

-I would set the "StartDriver" procedures to not have the ";SILENT" handle at the end to be
able to see what the drivers are actually doing to help troubleshoot problems. If you have
issues with the chambers not responding but the driver is started, make sure to check the Digi
devices either next to or behind the chambers. There should be a small black box with a black
power cable and a blue ethernet running to one side, and a black and yellow ethernet connected
to the other side. Make sure the black and yellow ethernet cables are connected to the middle 2
of the 4 ports on the opposite side of the blue ethernet cable, and the yellow should be closer
to the side of the box that the blue ethernet cable is connected to, while the black one goes
to the other open port in the middle.

-If you start iTest and the thermocouples like tBattNegative are not reading correctly, check
CirAssignChans.dat for whether or not the respective channels are assigned to anything, check
the assigned channels for the circuits by going to the "Circuit Editor" window under "Battery 
Setup" in the Test Manager solution tree, and check the Bitrode driver "Assignable database" 
at the bottom of the driver configuration window in Test Manager and make sure any of the 
tCyclerX_1X Channels are on "Slot" 3.

-If there are issues with getting iTest to connect with LabCentral, even if you use "Test
Connection" from the iView setup from the bottom right of the taskbar tray, it may be an issue
with LabCentral "handshaking back", in which case you just need to make an edit to the
description of the "BcTS" Test System Group in LabCentral, under Test Systems. When you make
an edit and select "save", it will force a communication push TO the iTest machine and you
should be able to make a connection.
