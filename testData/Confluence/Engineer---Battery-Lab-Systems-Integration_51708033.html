To achieve our vision of a world with Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions and Zero Congestion, we need people to join us who are passionate about creating safer, better and more sustainable ways for people to get around. This bold vision won’t happen overnight, but just as we transformed how the world moved in the last century, we are committed to transforming how we move today and in the future.</p><h4 id="EngineerBatteryLabSystemsIntegration-Summary"><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">The Lab System Integration Engineer (LSIE) directly supports the development and validation of current and future battery technologies within General Motors’ electrification portfolio. The LSIE is primarily responsible for understanding testing methods and procedures and translating them into test scripts suitable for the test automation equipment used within the lab. This role directly affects the quality, durability and performance of electrified vehicles and related products developed by General Motors.</p><p style="text-align: left;">This job is based in General Motors’ Warren, Michigan Global Battery Systems Lab (GBSL-W). This facility uses extensive automation to operate 24/7 with only one shift of personnel, covers over 100,000 sq. ft. on the Warren Technical Center campus and has capabilities to test 108 battery packs or modules and 120 battery cells simultaneously. The facility has testing capabilities including traditional environmental testing, vibration, safety and abuse and exploratory development testing. GBSL-W maintains commonality with GM’s battery lab located in Shanghai, China (GBSL-S). The lab and results it produces are used by GM’s growing team of engineers working on advanced batteries and electrified vehicles, in support of the vision of a world with Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions and Zero Congestion.</p><p>The LSIE role is a good fit for a qualified individual who is interested in state-of-the-art battery technologies and testing methods, system-level integration, and has an interest in computer programming, data science, and test execution. This role offers practical, hands-on product development experience in the growing field of vehicle electrification.</p><h4 id="EngineerBatteryLabSystemsIntegration-KeyResponsibilities"><strong><u>Key Responsibilities</u></strong></h4><ul><li>Develop and validate test scripts and associated equipment drivers, ensuring plans to meet timing requirements are safe and appropriate, understood and agreed upon by all stakeholders</li><li>Work closely with product engineering teams to comprehend new product functionality to facilitate the development and implementation of methods for integration with test automation equipment and test scripts</li><li>Provide troubleshooting support pertaining to the integration of test scripts, lab equipment and products being tested</li><li>Ensure test data generation, delivery and storage methods are appropriate to meet or exceed quality standards and stakeholder expectations</li><li>Support the lab’s physical networking capabilities by championing collaboration and projects with internal and external IT and test automation organizations</li><li>Maintain awareness of testing equipment and methods and evaluate them for adoption, championing innovation projects to integrate new technologies</li><li>Work in a collaborative, software release oriented team atmosphere, actively participating in peer review of teammates’ test scripts and related projects</li><li>Identify and engage in continuous improvement projects aimed at maturing existing testing methods, including a push to increase efficiency while maintaining commonality across multiple test stands</li></ul><h3 id="EngineerBatteryLabSystemsIntegration-Qualifications"><strong><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);">Qualifications</span></strong></h3><h4 id="EngineerBatteryLabSystemsIntegration-Minimum"><strong><u>Minimum </u></strong></h4><ul><li><p style="text-align: left;">B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Computer Science</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>High level of interest in the vehicle electrification space</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Demonstrated proficiency in a high-level programming language, e.g. C, C++, C#, Java, Python, MATLAB</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Demonstrated ability to design and implement algorithms to automate tasks</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Ability to understand, utilize and debug common networking protocols, e.g. TCP, UDP, IP, mail slots, CAN, LIN, RS232, Ethernet</p></li><li><p style="text-align: left;">Demonstrated ability to work with a high level autonomy in a complex environment, managing multiple projects by establishing priorities and deliverables with minimal supervision</p></li></ul><h4 id="EngineerBatteryLabSystemsIntegration-Preferred"><strong><u>Preferred</u></strong></h4><ul><li><p style="text-align: left;">M.S.E. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Computer Science</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Battery systems product development and/or testing experience</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Software change control and release using the Git Ecosystem and Agile Methodology</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Programming of test automation systems, e.g. AND iTest, AVL Lynx, LabView, TestStand</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Use of common automotive debug and data acquisition tools, e.g. CANalyzer, VehicleSpy, INCA/MDA</p></li><li style="text-align: left;"><p>Knowledge of traditional product development, validation and release timing, milestones and methodologies</p></li><li><p style="text-align: left;">Experience working in an ISO 17025 or ISO 9001 accredited environment</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);"><strong>Job</strong>:</span> Engineering</p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);"><strong>Primary Location</strong>:</span> Estes Engineering Center (EEC), Warren, MI</p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);"><strong>Hiring Manager</strong></span>:</p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);"><strong>Organization</strong>:</span> Global Energy Strategy, Cert &amp; Compliance, &amp; Test Labs</p><p><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);"><strong>Posting Date</strong>:</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:var(--ds-text-accent-blue,#0055cc);">Job Level / Grade:</span> </strong></p>
